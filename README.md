# IIIF-Sandbox

A playground to test and demonstrate how various IIIF Viewers work with
different digital objects. Fair warning, this is a work in progress, we make no
guarantee any of the viewers on this site will work or be useful in any way.
We can only guarantee that we are working really hard to make sure that these
viewers will at some point be useful. Try back again if they are disappointing
today.

## Geting Started

To use this project:

1. Clone to some directory
* Modify `_data/manifests.yml` with manifests you'd like to provide as a demonstration
* Tweak `style.css` and HTML files in `_layouts` to personalize
* Run `jekyll serve` to generate site locally
* View it by going to `http://localhost:4000` and make sure it looks good
* If all is well, upload contents of `_site` to your server
* Repeat as necessary to keep the site up to date
